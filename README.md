This is my Kotlin Dice Roller Project

It's intention is to allow the user to roll as many dice up to a limit for whatever purpose they need for dice rolling.
So far this only goes up to 20 six sided die.

The user may add dice up to 20
They made remove dice up to 0
have not yet added a remove all feature. 
Very simple UI.
